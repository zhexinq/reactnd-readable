# Readable API Server

This is the project for the final assessment project for Udacity's Redux course -- a content and comment web app. Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

/api-server includes the code for the backend API Server for the app to store/interact with App data
/frontend includes the React code for frontend presentation and state management
